# Code Collaboration with Git & GitHub

Learning how to share and collaborate on code projects using Git and GitHub.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

You will need Python installed on your machine.

### Running

```sh
python3 guess.py
```

<details>
<summary>Known issues with the guess.py</summary>
This is intended for the students to figure out what is wrong with the code.

1. Unused `import math` that should be removed.
2. Attempts should initially be set to zero.
3. The print should be before the `count += 1`
4. The code should handle invalid inputs.
5. There should be comments explaining parts of the code.
